         * 
         * You should demonstrate that:
         * 1. Your constructor properly initializes the lists (4 points)
         * 2. You can add a new student at a specific index (4 points)
         * 3. Failing students are properly removed (4 points)
         * 4. The average calculation works correctly (4 points)
         * 5. Bonus points are properly applied (4 points)
         * 
         * Use System.out.println() to show the results of your tests.
         * The toString() method will help you display the current state. Remember this can be called implicitly on an object.
         * 
         * Example test structure:
         * StudentRecords records = new StudentRecords();
         * System.out.println("Initial records:");
         * System.out.println(records);
         * 
         * // Add your own tests here...
         */
